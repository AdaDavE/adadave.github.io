        <p class="p-2">For this assignment we analyzed my work's website: </p>
        <img src="../img/cyprusfull.png" alt="A screenshot of Cypruscu.com's homepage." class="w-100 pb-3"/>
        <p class="p-2">This blog post is that assignment, but with some images using ALT text and showing how
          the site looks with longer forms of content that should be broken up into sections.
        </p>

        <h4 class="p-2 text-decoration-underline">Overall usability</h4>
        <p class="p-2">
          The site is very straightforward. It knows that most users are going to navigate to it for accessing their 
          home banking, so that section is the biggest and most prominent. It does double as advertising as well showing 
          loan and savings rates though this is slightly further down. At the top it has common needed items such as 
          their phone number, routing number, etc.</p>

        <h4 class="p-2 text-decoration-underline">Experience</h4>
        <p class="p-2">The site has quite a bit going on since it has a lot it needs to do. But it marks everything
          clearly and looks nice and organized. If you’re looking to schedule an appointment it might be easy to 
          miss that it’s above the navigation bar. Additionally there’s two login spots for home banking, a small 
          ‘Login’ at the top and then the bigger box in the middle of the page. Both do the same thing, and may 
          seem a bit redundant to have the smaller one when the space could be used elsewhere. Having one item 
          appear in multiple places is useful for people who think differently or use the site differently, but is 
          the main source of complaints as some people may think they do different things since they’re in different
          places.
          <img src="../img/cyprusheader.png" alt="The very top of the website. One of the icons is a small 'login' button" class="w-100 pb-3"/>
        </p>

        <h4 class="p-2 text-decoration-underline">Visceral </h4>
        <p class="p-2">Visually the site looks very nice, it has a great color scheme that draws users' eyes to 
          important functions such as the login button. Looks nicely organized, and is not too cluttered.</p>

        <h4 class="p-2 text-decoration-underline">Behavioral</h4>
        <p class="p-2">Like mentioned above the site is pretty straightforward, it follows the usual design that 
          most are familiar with. A navigation system that you can click tabs to get to where you need, a login 
          button being a prominent point on the page, search bar at the top, slides to show new features or news, 
          etc. It makes it easy to navigate.</p>

        <h4 class="p-2 text-decoration-underline">Reflective</h4>
        <p class="p-2">Combining the two and looking more after the fact, reflectively I would use this site again 
          if I had to. It seems well organized, pleasing to the eye, and not overwhelmingly complex to use which 
          usually is the case for people to avoid using websites unless forced.</p>

        <h4 class="p-2 text-decoration-underline">Signifiers/Affordances</h4>
        <p class="p-2">Many of these Signifiers double as an Affordance when it comes to web design. Most things 
          are labeled signifying what to do with either the button or input box. An affordance clue is when you 
          hover over an icon the cursor can change the cursor to a pointing finger, a clue that it can be clicked, 
          typed in by giving a highlight, or some other sort of indication like an underlining of the text.</p>

        <h4 class="p-2 text-decoration-underline">Some Signifiers</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Big logo in the corner telling you where you are.</li>
            <li>Sections at the top for a category on the site</li>
            <li>Arrows on tabs signifying a category</li>
            <li>Underlining of links to show clickability</li>
            <li>Input boxes being labeled</li>         
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 class="p-2 text-decoration-underline">Some Affordances</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rates advertised with ‘As Low as’ indicating best possible deal</li>
            <li>Big red button (affordance, inviting to click) labeled ‘LOGIN’ (signal, what it does)</li>
            <li>Color scheme seems inviting and professional. Draw your eyes to specific things such as 
              ‘appointments’ and ‘become a member’ being bright green and orange.</li>
          </ul>
