          My name is Adam Evans. The whole point of this site was a project for my web-design class.
          This was an attempt to show off some features of accessible design, and make a pretty presentable
          and professional looking website. This website is also a first for me in being much more mobile friendly
          than previous web projects I've worked on.
        </p>
        <p class="p-2">
          This site should be usable for screen readers. All images have ALT text, and all videos have captions
          added for those who cannot hear well or are in a place where sound would be inconvenient.
          I also spent some time testing this site with a color inverter. A black-and-white/gray color scheme is 
          very visible to many people and has high contrast. However I also know that those colors aren't always 
          the most visible. The site works well with a color-inverter, though some images may look funny.
        </p>
        <p class="p-2">I used the Chrome extension
          <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/invert/heidajcpkemganilmhockdniaknoojih">Invert!</a> 
          to test inverting colors on the site. I almost think it would
          look better if this was the default.</p>

        <p>
          Lastly, the site was inspired partially by neumorphism. This design language has a lot to hate about it,
          but I thought adding some subtle borders would make a huge difference to make the overall design more
          visually appealing and easier to see.
