         <div class="articleparagraphs">
            <p>Recently, I had a chat with a friend of mine from high school. She and her fiancee are both still college age, and now living on their own. As they recently moved up to the Salt Lake area for their blossoming careers, they found getting an apartment to rent was a downright freaky process. It wasn’t until they had just about 2 weeks before they absolutely would have to move from their old place that they were able to find a new apartment, after months of searching. It seems this was due to landlords wanting tenants who would move in as soon as possible. Unbelievably, this was in one of the nation’s top housing markets. (<em>Marco Santarelli</em>) As it turns out, what ends up being great for investors and real estate gurus is an absolute nightmare for the average person who just needs shelter. There needs to be a limit on how much property can be bought for investment, or else we will have more homeless on the streets beneath empty apartment units.</p>
            <p>A recent overview by Norada Real Estate Investments happily states “[The] Utah housing market has been ranked as the nation’s #1 housing market...” (<em>Marco Santarelli</em>) Santarelli further continues to discuss in his overview the potential profits to be made by investors in Utah’s housing sector. It is true that Utah’s economy has been booming for quite some time. You can see this just looking out your window at the downtown area that is garnished with multiple construction projects. It’s expected that the investors Santarelli is talking to would therefore have more of an interest in buying properties here instead of places like California or Oregon, which are infamous for their high housing costs. In Fact, Santarelli is sure to mention this in his overview, adding “the $400,000 house in Utah with four bedrooms and a yard looks cheap when you sold a two-bedroom condo for 50% more in California.” It seems like a sort of feedback-loop. You have people relocating here from places like California for their work. Then there’s an increase and boom in economic activity, which causes the investors over there to also get interested and buy up the property here as well. The end result is today, with a lack of supply, and people such as myself and my peers struggling with having to make life sacrifices and decisions to keep up with a rapidly rising rental price. All while investors are trying to make a profit from the difficulties average people are having. </p>
            <p>Continuing on the issue of rising prices, I must now talk about the wage issues tied up in all of this. The Salt Lake Tribune reports “Median incomes in Utah have stayed all but flat since 2002 even as it’s economy has often thrived…” (<em>Tony Semerad</em>) while the Deseret News observes “[In Salt Lake City] workers would need to earn a minimum of $23.15 an hour to afford a market rate, two-bedroom unit and avoid paying more than 30% of their income on housing.” (<em>Katie McKellar</em>) It’s absolutely understandable that people on the West Coast would want to move here to escape their own housing woes over there. But what happens to the Utahns who are now facing housing issues as a result? Renters are currently making up the majority of residents in Utah as they are priced out of houses (<em>McKellar</em>). Once again, real estate investors can be seen as part of the blame for this. The way I see it, these investors are seeing that they can take advantage of the rising demand and lack of supply, and use that to raise rent. “It is just how capitalism works” another friend of mine pointed out while discussing her own rent going higher. And she’s right, that’s just how the business has to work. But do we need to have firms such as Norada and their clients buying up so much property and renting it? When rents are approaching similar rates to home mortgages, (<em>McKellar</em>) it almost seems like the renter is losing, paying as if they own a property, but in the end they don’t own it at all. </p>
            <p>One of the most mind-boggling ‘solutions’ I have seen about this problem, especially concerning students, is the ‘Van Life’ trend. As rents rise, younger people in college can’t always afford to do school and pay the rents at the same time, or at least while keeping their sanity. While this issue is compounded by the continuing rise of education costs as well, the housing issues serve to make being a student hellish. There is a group of students living near Utah State University who live in their vans. (<em>Moore</em>) The lifestyle isn’t glamorous, and many of these students seem to claim that they like it. Granted, I would like it too if my only alternatives were predatory renting costs and absurdly expensive tuition or being outright homeless. These students living in their vans are considered part of the homeless population, however, unlike many people we think of as ‘homeless’ these students were fortunate enough to have a car or other vehicle/asset they could either trade in for a van or adapt into a car they could live out of. For some it is considered the dream or an ideal. (<em>Moore</em>) In my opinion that comes from internet stars with more time and resources showing off fancier builds and setups than a lot of other people on a budget or strapped entirely for cash could come up with. Fortunately, lawmakers do see this as a symptom of a growing homeless student problem, and have introduced a bill to expand low income housing statutes to college students. (<em>Moore</em>) Once again however, how will this combat the fact that much of the housing these students could be using is instead insanely expensive because of the rental prices these investment companies are driving up? Rather than spending more government resources to help the average person as they’re getting exploited by a company, why not cut it off at the head and instead place restrictions on how much property could be bought by rental companies? Why not try to better regulate rental practices to avoid such predatory rates? </p>
            <p>One of the most common proposals thrown around is that we need to just build more and more houses to supply the demand. I don’t think that the issue is that simple, nor does housing economist David Fields, declaring “The housing market is more nuanced than the perceived condition of a housing supply constraint” (<em>Semrad</em>) I once again point to the many cranes dotting the SLC skyline. There’s currently a record high of 32,000 building permits for residential projects. Matt Ulrich, who’s president for the board of realtors calculates a rate of 30,000 units a year being built will take 10 years to stabilize the housing gap (<em>McKellar</em>) In my mind a question still remains: How many of those new properties will actually be bought by families looking for a place to live? How many are going to end up being rental properties owned by an investment firm? Currently, in my research at least, the answer is unclear. Many of the building projects I walked by near downtown were high-rise dwellings and duplexes. While many of these are likely to end up being condominium units, the vast majority of them seem slotted to be luxury apartment rentals based on the signs “call to rent when available!” nearby. So while it is not entirely certain that they ALL will be rental units owned by a larger firm, it definitely seems that these projects will just allow more people to experience paying 50% or more of their income just on rent. (<em>Semerad</em>) I believe we should actively have some sort of law or zoning regulation that would restrict the amount of ‘to-rent’ housing in favor of more ‘to-own’ housing. This solution is up to the cooperation of our state legislators. The question is if they are willing to take action.</p>
            <p>As Utah’s market starts to head towards outright price exhaustion, and the average person ends up finding affordable housing more and more out of reach, (<em>McKellar</em>) what will be done about the rental prices that keep on going up and up? Once again, I believe firmly that this is a symptom of large real estate firms gobbling up the property to rent out and make a profit whilst alienating potential families and buyers. As lawmakers begin to look towards giving assistance to renters, who will then pay it to those companies for rent, there will still be people paying half of their income for a roof over their heads they don’t and can’t even own. I believe we all owe a call to our state representatives and legislature. Ask them why they would rather indirectly subsidize these rental investment companies rather than make it so more of these properties end up in the hands of Utahns. </p>
