         <h1>The 20-Something Conundrum</h1>
         <h5 class="subtitle">By Adam Evans</h5>
         
         <div class="articleparagraphs">
            <p>It was a typical Tuesday afternoon in June. I was driving to a friend’s apartment. As I drove, the savory scent of sausage, cheese, and yeast from the pizza I was bringing wafted around my car. I stopped at an intersection, and spent a bit of time attempting futility to find ways to keep the warm evening sun from blinding me. As I continued on to my friend’s apartment, I couldn’t help but feel a bit envious. I’d love to live in my own place, but rent is pretty expensive as of late, and it seems to be getting worse.</p>
            <p>Earlier I had read an article about students who were living in their Vans. They couldn’t afford to rent an apartment or dorm, so they had to make do.  While the article said that they were technically homeless, they thought that it could be a solution to the housing issue gripping the state. (<em>Carter Moore</em>) I thought it was a rather stupid solution to a housing crisis that’s gripped the state as of lately.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, for me I don’t have the issue of living on the edge of homelessness, or riding out variable weather conditions in a stuffy, cramped van that’s also my bedroom. At that moment, the only issue I really had was the sun trying to blind me as I drove. I just live with my parents. Some people might find it a bit sad that I’m 20 and still living at home. I would move if I could. I yearn for that glorious period of self-discovery and exploration many college students have at my age. However, independence is what I’ve chosen to currently sacrifice in exchange for school and a roof over my head. With how things are, it seems everyone has to make some choice between their life’s goals.</p>
            <p>I finally arrived at my friend’s apartment complex. It looks like a pretty nice place. It’s wood veneers and fresh paint almost sparkled in the setting sun. I pulled into the parking garage, and, not knowing where my friend’s apartment was, just chose the first spot. The garage was dark, but also dry and arid. I parked, and then maneuvered around my car’s grey fabric seats to gather up my belongings, pizza, soda, and all. I shuffled along the rough concrete into the building. I was immediately greeted with the elevator to my right, humming in quiet solitude. I pressed a foggy button to call the elevator, awkwardly maneuvering my arms full of various items to ensure I didn’t drop them. The elevator was surprisingly large, with a spongy matted floor. The lights were muted, combined with the sharp scent of cigarettes. I pressed a button and the elevator quietly squeaked up to the 2nd floor. I was greeted with more muted lighting and the bland interior of a warm hallway that sharply contrasted the neatly designed exterior. Standing in front of me was my friend’s smiling face. She greeted me and led me inside her apartment. The rest of my friends and her boyfriend greeted me in excited tones and greetings while a fluffy, black cat stared at me in judgmental familiarity. Her apartment is very nice, at least with how she was sure to take care of it. I couldn’t help but notice how small it was. It seemed plenty big enough for the 5 of us plus two cats to hang out without being too uncomfortable. Any more people, and it would’ve started to be too crowded. </p>
            <p>So it seems despite there being a housing crisis, that at a glance my friend must have managed to be spared from it. But much like how I gave up having my own apartment and living with my parents to complete school, my friend has had to give up school in order to live in her own apartment. She told me she pays $950/month for her small apartment. It’s sometimes 80% of her income. She isn’t able to live with her parents since they got divorced. I was shocked to hear that her rent was being raised by nearly 300 more, and so she would be moving. “That’s just how the market is,” she told me. Meanwhile, those students living out of their vans at USU don’t have a stable roof above their heads in exchange for independence and an education. Maybe having to live with my parents for now isn’t too bad of a thing. Not everyone is fortunate to have that option, especially as homeless college students become more common. (<em>Moore</em>) </p>
