         <h2>A note from the Editor:</h2>
         <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Adam Evans. This site is all about the current housing crunch in the Salt Lake area of Utah. Below you can find links to a few articles I have written on the issue. They include a memoir of my own experiences, a profile of one of my friends who's in the middle of the crisis, an informational analysis, and finally a persuasive letter. I hope you enjoy your time on my site. The top bar is the navigation for the whole site. The articles are under the 'Articles' tab, just click it to see a drop-down list of all the articles for the class. There is also a navigation to a page with more about me, and another with all the sources used in my research. Thanks for visiting!</p>

               <p class="articlep">This article is a heavy opinion-based piece. I discuss many of the issues I have researched and explain why you should care more about them. I analyze different solutions that have come up through my research and explain why I do or do not like them. In the end I present my own 'call-to-action' that may prove to have some help, even if it's very small.</p>
