            <h3>Here's a bit about us!</h3>
               <p>Founded in 19xx in a small town in Italy, our founder decided to go to a new place to get more business. Something happened and he landed in this new town where we are based today. Our mission is to bring you the finest pizza to your taste. Unlike our competition, we use a wood-fired oven, kept at a toasty 600F. You can ensure that every pizza will be quality and taste delicious, every single time.</p>
