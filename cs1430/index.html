         <h2>My CSIS 1430 Experience</h2>
         	<p>I honestly had a blast with this course. I’ve been really enjoying my CSIS major so far, and this course really used a lot of skills I’ve had in a few of my hobbies, specifically art. One of the things I was slightly concerned about when I chose to go into the CSIS field was that I wouldn’t get to use some of the design skills I learned through my art hobby. In this class I got to use my artistic skills a lot more than other CSIS or STEM classes. It was a lot of fun using some artistic skills to make websites and get a bit creative. That’s what I’ve really enjoyed about CSIS in general, I’m a very creative person and these classes require a good amount of creativity to solve problems or, with this class, make things look neat and nice. </p>

           <p>This class was a shift away from the previous CSIS work I’ve done. I was creating front-end programs and webpages/apps that people will see. With most programming your stuff is behind the program, it’s hidden. With this course I had more showy things to show off for a portfolio or to show friends and family. One thing the current pandemic has helped is that I have no shortage of people I can find to test out accessibility and how things look so I can adjust it. Always having a second pair of eyes keeps you from being completely blind at least.</p>

            <p>There’s this weird feeling of euphoria I get everytime I get a webpage to look how I want, or function as I was wanting. It’s like watching your kid walk for the first time or, since I play piano, watching someone play or perform something I taught them. It makes me feel incredibly happy. It’s such a super addicting feeling.</p>

            <p>Finally, I couldn’t manage to do all this good programming if it wasn’t for all the resources at my fingertips. I think it’s amazing how you can find many different suggestions or approaches to something. I often would look through several ways to implement or do some sort of web design or javascript program, and end up making something that was some sort of hybrid between it all. Infact, this class helped me with my other CSIS class, 1410. I was able to use the HTML and CSS stuff I learned in here to do some neat text-formatting and design on the GUIs we were creating. I think it was pretty neat to have everything come together like that. I’m looking forward to my future classes and using all of these languages and skills together more and more to make more complex and fun things. </p>
            
            <p>A couple things about this site -- this is a portfolio with some highlights of things I worked on in this class. The dancing 'Inspire Me!' button will change the quote on the top of the page to one of 8 random ones, and play a little victory song. (check your volume!) The projects are sorted in drop-down menus at the top of the page. To visit my general SLCC ePortfolio, click the logo (Adam Evans 1430). Thanks for visiting! </p>
